# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
*It's been a very long day and long week, I'm not firing on all cylinders at the moment and this exercise took longer than it should have. I'm about a 6 out of 10 when it comes to built-in ruby methods. I need to explore more complex methods in the future.*
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
*I'm even less confident when it comes to writing simple methods but I will come back to this in the AM to review.*
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
*can I go to bed yet? What is the longest method you have ever written in terms of lines of code?*
